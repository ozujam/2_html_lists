### Artical Section

HTML has a special element for creating **lists**.

HTML has two sets of lists, *unordered* list and *ordered* list.

An *unordered* HTML list:

- Item
- Item
- Item

An *ordered* HTML list:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

An *unordered* list starts with the `<ul>` tag. 
Each *list* item starts with the `<li>` tag.
The list items will be marked with **bullets** (small black circles) by default:

```
<ul>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ul>

```

An *ordered* list starts with the `<ol>` tag. 
Each *list* item starts with the `<li>` tag.
The list items will be marked with **numbers** by default:

```
<ol>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ol>

```
